### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a Coffee Chain over the course of six months. By analyzing the sales trends according to product type, over the course of six months, I sought to identify trends, make data-driven reccomendations, and gain a deeper understanding of Cafe-Delights-Coffee performance metrics with the end goal of maximizing sales by raising the total revenue by twenty percent.
